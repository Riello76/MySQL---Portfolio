## 2. Key Skills Demonstrated

### 💾 SQL & Database Management
The repository shows strong command over SQL principles:
* **Schema Design:** Successfully creating and defining relational schemas (Northwind, World DB).
* **Data Integrity:** Implementing Primary and Foreign Keys to enforce data integrity.
* **Complex Querying:** Expert use of `JOIN` types, subqueries, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions for detailed reporting.

### 📊 Business Intelligence & Visualization
Projects demonstrate the ability to take analytical results and transform them into engaging visual stories:
* Experience with industry-standard BI tools (Tableau, Power BI).
* Focus on domain-specific dashboards (e.g., EMSI UK).

### 🔍 Data Analysis & Exploration
The analysis projects (`Health_dataset`, `Spotify`) highlight skills in end-to-end data processing:
* Data cleaning and pre-processing.
* Statistical summarization and trend identification.
* Generating data-driven conclusions.
