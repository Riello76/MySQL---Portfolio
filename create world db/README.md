# World Database Project

In this project, I created and explored the **World Database** to practice SQL queries, joins, and data visualization. All the work I did is displayed in the accompanying workbook.

## What I Did

1. **Database Creation**
   - Created the World Database with tables for countries, cities, and related data.
   - Defined primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Wrote SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and join data from multiple tables.
   - Practiced selecting specific columns, applying conditions, and aggregating data.

3. **Workbook Visualizations**
   - All queries and results are visualized in the workbook.
   - Provides clear tables and summaries for analysis and reference.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced creating and managing a relational database.
- Improved skills in writing SQL queries and joins.
- Learned how to structure data for meaningful analysis and visualization.

## Usage

- Open the workbook to see the queries and their results.
- Use the examples to understand database relationships, filtering, and aggregation.
- Useful for SQL practice, database design, and visualization exercises.
