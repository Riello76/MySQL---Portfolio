# 🗂 Northwind Database – Basic Queries

This project demonstrates **basic SQL queries** on the **Northwind Database**.  
The goal was to practice **selecting data, filtering records, and handling string and numeric values** effectively.

---

## 🛠 What I Did

1. **Selected Specific Records**  
   - Retrieved a product by its ID from the `Products` table  
   - Queried customers located in a specific city (`London`) from the `Customers` table  

2. **Applied Filters**  
   - Used numeric comparisons to find products with a **price greater than 100**  
   - Filtered orders placed after a specific date (`1996-07-30`) from the `Orders` table  

3. **Handled String Values**  
   - Ensured string values were enclosed in quotation marks (`''` or `""`)  
   - Practiced using `!=` and `<>` operators to exclude specific cities (`Madrid`)  

4. **Explored Query Variations**  
   - Tested different comparison operators for the same query  
   - Combined selection and filtering to get precise results from multiple tables

- Screenshots show the queries and their results  
- Demonstrates how queries return the expected data

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Practiced writing **basic SELECT statements** with `WHERE` conditions  
- Learned proper handling of **string and numeric values** in SQL  
- Gained experience using **comparison operators** to filter data effectively

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the **SQL script or queries** in your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench)  
2. Execute the queries to see **filtered results** and **selection logic**  
3. Use as a reference for **SQL practice and learning query fundamentals**
