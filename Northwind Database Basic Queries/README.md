# Northwind Database - Basic Queries

In this project, I explored the **Northwind Database** by writing and executing basic SQL queries. The goal was to practice selecting data, filtering records, and correctly handling string and numeric values.

## What I Did

1. **Selected Specific Records**
   - Retrieved a product by its ID from the `Products` table.
   - Queried customers located in a specific city (`London`) from the `Customers` table.
   
2. **Applied Filters**
   - Used numeric comparisons to find products with a price greater than 100.
   - Filtered orders placed after a specific date (`1996-07-30`) from the `Orders` table.

3. **Handled String Values**
   - Ensured that string values from the table were enclosed in quotation marks (`''` or `""`).
   - Practiced using `!=` and `<>` operators to filter out specific cities (`Madrid`).

4. **Explored Query Variations**
   - Tested different comparison operators for the same query to understand how SQL interprets them.
   - Combined selection and filtering to get precise results from multiple tables.

- I included screenshots of the queries and their results.
- Each screenshot demonstrates how the queries return the expected data.

## Key Learnings

- Practiced writing basic SELECT statements with WHERE conditions.
- Learned proper handling of string and numeric values in SQL.
- Gained experience using comparison operators to filter data effectively.
